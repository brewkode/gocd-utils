# GoCD Utils

Attempts to host a set of simple utilities that would make life easier when using GoCD extensively.

What utilities do you have currently?
- gocd_unused_params.py - which when given the cruise config xml, a pipeline group and name, returns you back the list of unused parameters for that pipeline. This is very useful when you know you've been carrying a lot of legacy and your pipelines have too many parameters.
